# car radio i

First [in progress] iteration of the car radio for a Three.js project featuring models of somewhat bygone music-listening devices.

Created the "car radio i"  model in Blender, exported it, and rendered it using Three.js.

Added the model to a scene with lighting and incorporated animations: sound upon clicking the power button and tuning/adjusting the volume by dragging the two dials.
